Project Overview

SafePal-AI is a real-time scam detection mobile application that monitors ongoing phone calls, transcribes conversations, performs speaker diarization, analyzes call intent using a Large Language Model (LLM), and instantly alerts users if scam activity is detected — while the call is still in progress.

This is not a spam-blocking app.
It is a conversation-understanding AI safety system.


Build a real-time scam detection backend in Flask that:

Accepts audio stream input

Transcribes using Whisper API

Performs speaker labeling

Maintains rolling transcript buffer

Sends transcript segments to GPT-4o

Returns JSON verdict with confidence and reason

Streams results to Flutter frontend via WebSocket

Structure the code modularly and production-ready.
